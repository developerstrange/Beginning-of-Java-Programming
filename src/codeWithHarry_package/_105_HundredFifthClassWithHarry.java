		 Java doc is used to generate documentation for our own package and class. 
		 We can generate java documentation through Powershell or IDE.
		 It helps us get info about which method, class, entity to use where.
		 Instead of looking others code directly we can read the java documentation if there's a generated java documentation.
		 Javadoc command allows us to create documentation in HTML format for our own package.
		 Java provides tags for class or package to assist with the java doc generation.
		 
		 Tags for class or a package:
		 @author - Adds the author name
		 @version - Adds the version
		 @Since - To add when was this version written
		 @See - Adds a see also heading with a link
